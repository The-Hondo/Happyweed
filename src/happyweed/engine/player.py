# src/happyweed/engine/player.py
"""
Tick-based player mover with exact 'open tile' checks and buffered turns.

Key invariants (from the original LST & project doctrine):
- "Open" tiles are strictly 10..199 (inclusive).
- Movement is grid-based, one tile per tick update() call.
- A desired turn can be buffered; it executes as soon as the target tile is open.
- If neither the buffered turn nor forward direction is open, the player stays put.

This module does NOT impose scoring/leaf-consumptionâ€”callers can pass an
'on_enter' callback to mutate the grid and update score/lives etc.
